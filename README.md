# GPIOMonitor
This Bash script was created to help view your system's GPIO and their current state.  You can also pass a number to the script to have it refresh every x seconds.  

This was used while playing with a Reasberry Pi to see if certain componets toggled the GPIO on the board or to even find what GPIO was related to that component by see what GPIO Changed as I hit a switch.
